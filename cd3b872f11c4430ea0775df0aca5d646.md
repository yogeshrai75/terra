# Migrating from SVN to Git

This guide provides detailed instructions for migrating a Subversion
(SVN) repository to a Git repository, including how to extract author
information and log the entire process.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the migration, ensure you have the following:

-   Access to the SVN Repository: Ensure you have read access to the SVN
    repository you wish to migrate.

-   GitHub Account and Repository: Create a new repository on GitHub
    where the migrated code will be pushed.

-   Git Installed: Ensure Git is installed on your system.

-   GitHub Personal Access Token: Generate a personal access token with
    the \'repo\' scope on GitHub.

-   SVN Client: Ensure that an SVN client (e.g., the \`svn\`
    command-line tool) is installed on your system.

-   Git SVN Extension: Install the \`git-svn\` extension, which allows
    Git to interact with SVN repositories.

-   Installing GIT-SVN Extension

**On Ubuntu/Debian**

Run the following commands to install git-svn:

sudo apt update

sudo apt install git git-svn subversion

**Verify the installation**:

git svn \--version

## Migration Steps

### 1. Extract Authors from SVN

To maintain accurate commit history during the migration, it\'s
important to map SVN authors to Git authors. Follow these steps:

1.  Open a terminal window.

2.  Checkout the SVN repository using the command below, replacing
    \`svn://server_ip/repo/project\` with the actual URL of your SVN
    repository:.

Extract author information and save it to a file named
\`authors-transform.txt\` using the following command:

svn log svn://server_ip/repo/project -q \| awk -F \'\|\' \'/\^r/
{sub(\"\^ \", \"\", \$2); sub(\" \$\", \"\", \$2); print \$2\" = \"\$2\"
\<\"\$2\"\>\"}\' \| sort -u \> authors-transform.txt

This command parses the SVN commit history, extracts the author names,
and formats them into a format compatible with Git.

# Steps to fetch the Github Token

## Login to GitHub

-   Go to [[https://github.com/]{.underline}](https://github.com/) and
    > log in to your account.

## Navigate to Developer Settings

height="3.192318460192476in"}

-   Click on your profile picture (top-right corner).

-   Go to Settings.

-   Scroll down and select Developer settings on the left menu.

## Access Personal Access Tokens

height="2.861111111111111in"}

-   In the left sidebar, click on Personal access tokens.

-   Select Tokens (classic) if you want a classic PAT.

## Generate New Token

-   Click on Generate new token (or Generate new token (classic) for
    > classic tokens).

-   If prompted, re-enter your password for security.

## Configure the Token

-   Note: Provide a meaningful name to identify this token.

-   Expiration: Set an expiration date for the token.

-   Scopes: Select the permissions (scopes) you need:

    -   For accessing repositories: Select repo.

    -   For workflow automation: Select workflow.

    -   For user access: Select read:user or other user-related scopes.

    -   For full access: Choose the required permissions based on your
        > needs.

## Generate the Token

-   Scroll down and click on Generate token.

-   Copy the token immediately! You will not be able to see it again.

### 2. Pull the Migration Script

Next, create a shell script to automate the migration process.

1.  Clone the script from github

Git clone
[[https://github.com/onlinesales-ai/devOpsTools.git]{.underline}](https://github.com/onlinesales-ai/devOpsTools.git)

2.  Make changes as given below

#!/bin/bash\
\
svn_repo=\"svn://YOUR_SVN_SERVER_URL/YOUR_SVN_REPO\"\
github_repo=\"git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git\"\
svn_username=\"YOUR_SVN_USERNAME\"\
svn_password=\"YOUR_SVN_PASSWORD\"\
github_username=\"YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME\"\
github_token=\"YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\"\
authors_file=\"./YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/authors-transform.txt\"

Replace the placeholder values (\`YOUR_SVN_SERVER_URL\`,
\`YOUR_USERNAME\`, \`YOUR_REPOSITORY\`, etc.) with your actual data.

**Note :- For Accessing Github token Steps are mentioned at the end of
this document.**

### 3. Execute the Migration Script

You can now run the script to perform the migration.

2.  Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the
    \`migrate.sh\` script is saved.

3.  Make the script executable by running:

chmod +x svntogit.sh

If you prefer not to use a job scheduler, execute the script directly in
the background, logging the process to a file:

nohup ./svntogit.sh \> svntogit.log 2\>&1 &

\- This command runs the script in the background.\
- Output and errors are redirected to \`svntogit.log\`, allowing you to
monitor the migration process.

# 2. User Guide for Onboarding New Node Service

This document provides instructions for developers to onboard a new Node
service using the provided GitHub Actions workflow. Follow the steps
outlined below to set up and run the pipeline.

## Workflow Details

The workflow file is named: \*\*Onboarding New Node Service\*\*

This GitHub Actions workflow helps in setting up and deploying a new
Node service. It performs the following tasks:

\- Authenticates with Google Cloud using the provided credentials.\
- Initializes and applies Terraform configuration to set up required
infrastructure.\
- Modifies CI workflow files and Helm charts for the new service.\
- Creates an ApplicationSet for ArgoCD service deployment.\
- Configures trigger workflows for the mainline and release branches.\
- Syncs changes with the application and GitOps repositories.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure the repository variable and secrets are configured properly

**Secrets:**

-   SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY: Google Cloud service account credentials.

-   GITHUBS_PAT: GitHub Personal Access Token for accessing
    > repositories.

-   CONFIG_EMAIL: Git user email for commits.

-   CONFIG_USER: Git user name for commits.

**Variable:**

-   REGION_LIST : List of region
    > (asia-south1,asia-southeast1,europe-west1,us-central1,us-east4)

## Input Variables

The following variables need to be provided by the developer when
triggering the workflow from the GitHub Actions console:

-   NODE_VERSION: The version of Node.js to be used. Options: 16.15.0,
    12.18.0, 17.15.0.

-   REPOSITORY: The name of the repository for the service. It will be
    generated based on SERVICE_NAME.

-   IMAGE_NAME: The name of the Docker image for the service. It will be
    generated based on SERVICE_NAME.

## Steps to Trigger the Workflow

Follow these steps to trigger the workflow:

1\. Navigate to the GitHub Actions tab in the repository.\
2. Select the \*\*Onboarding New Node Service\*\* workflow.\
3. Click on the \*\*Run workflow\*\* button.\
4. Fill in the required input fields (NODE_VERSION, DOCKERFILE_NAME,
SERVICE_NAME, etc.) in the form.\
5. Click on the \*\*Run workflow\*\* button to start the pipeline.
